# Tackle

## File structure

### Questions
Line by line
### Answers
Line by line
### Metadata
Line 1 - Time allocated
Line 2 - INSTANT or NOTINSTANT (quiz type)

## KNOWN BUGS
Not wanting to override files when they haven't been deleted in a quiz <br />
just crashes when a network error occurs - Networking.cs needs threads

## TO DO IMMEDIATELY
Make it so that the teacher can read student's attempts at a quiz <br />
Make QuizResults screen actually functional <br />
Add quiz title to the metadata and stuff like that
